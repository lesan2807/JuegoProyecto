This is an educational game based on trigonometry. The user must apply his knowledge in angles to give direction to the balls and try to sink them in the different holes that will appear in the board.

The player first has 3 balls, they will be in a tube on a small circle. This circle will be located in the center of a bigger one. The largest circle will have different holes distributed around its area, and depending on their size the user wins or loses points.

At the beginning the holes only give points. As the user gets to a certain amount of points some holes will reduce the player's score. As the game progresses, different holes will appear, and these will have specific characteristics. For example, at any point of the game there will be a hole that, if the user inserts the ball, it will give him more balls to play. But there is going to be a hole that will destroy the balls as well.

To increase the difficult, so the game doesn't become boring, instead of asking for an angle in degrees, the game will change so the player has to guide the balls with radians. This will give the user a more complete review in trigonometry.
